# hinoki

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snd/hinoki.png)](https://travis-ci.org/snd/hinoki)

**magical inversion of control for nodejs**

hinoki can manage complexity in nodejs applications.

it is inspired by [prismatic's graph](https://github.com/Prismatic/plumbing#graph-the-functional-swiss-army-knife) and [angular's dependency injection](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di).

*Hinoki takes its name from the hinoki cypress, a tree that only grows in Japan and is the preferred wood for building palaces, temples and shrines.*
